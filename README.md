# Data Analysis Project for Computer Hardware Business

This repository contains a data analysis project to provide real-time sales insights for a computer hardware business using Power BI.

## Overview

1. **Data Extraction**: Extracted data from a `.sql` file.
2. **EDA**: Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis using Jupyter notebooks.
3. **Power BI Dashboard**: Built a dashboard for real-time sales insights.

This project focuses on providing real-time sales insights for a computer hardware business using Power BI. The data was extracted from a .sql file and processed for analysis. Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted using Jupyter notebooks to uncover key trends and patterns. The final Power BI dashboard offers dynamic visualizations and key performance indicators, enabling the sales director to make informed decisions in a rapidly changing market. This project exemplifies the end-to-end process of data extraction, analysis, and visualization, providing valuable insights and decision-making tools for the business.
